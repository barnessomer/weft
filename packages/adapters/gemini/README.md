# @weft/adapter-gemini — WCP adapter for Gemini CLI hooks (FIXTURE-TESTED ONLY)

> No live Gemini CLI run backs this adapter. Gemini CLI's free OAuth tier was retired
> (UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT; unpaid users moved to Antigravity CLI on 2026-06-18) and no Gemini API
> key is available to the project. The mapping follows the documented reference
> (https://geminicli.com/docs/hooks/reference) and is exercised with fixture payloads only.

The hook command translates Gemini CLI payloads onto the shared WCP core
(`packages/adapters/claude-code/src`, via `host.ts`).

```sh
WEFT_TOKEN=... node dist/weft-gemini.mjs install --url … --repo … --agent gemini-e --task T-6
```

`install` merges our matcher groups into `.gemini/settings.json` (hook `name: "weft-gemini"`;
foreign groups kept; excluded from git), plus `.weft/gemini.json`, the token, git hooks and
`.weft/bin/weft`.

| Gemini event | core event | output (documented) | level |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | SessionStart | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` (prepended to the prompt headless) | L1 |
| `BeforeAgent` | UserPromptSubmit | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` | L1 |
| `BeforeTool` `write_file` / `replace` | PreToolUse check | `decision:"deny"` + `reason` (sent to the agent as the tool error) | L2 |
| `BeforeTool` `run_shell_command` `git commit` | PreToolUse Bash | deny while errors are open | commit_gate |
| `AfterTool` | PostToolUse | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` (appended to the tool result) | L1 |
| `AfterAgent` | Stop | `decision:"deny"` + `reason` → retry turn with the reason as prompt | L3 |
| `SessionEnd` | SessionEnd | best effort (the CLI does not wait) | |

`replace` with `expected_replacements > 1` maps to a replace-all edit. Gemini tool calls carry no
call id, so Before/After are paired by a key derived from the tool input. Hooks print nothing
but the JSON answer ("silence is mandatory").

Declared capabilities (documented): `{level: 3, observe: sync, inject: immediate, deny_edit, refuse_stop, commit_gate: tool_interception}`.

# @weft/adapter-opencode — WCP adapter for OpenCode (L3)

Connects an [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) checkout to a Weft coordinator (WCP v0.1). OpenCode
has no command hooks; it loads JS plugins into its own process. `install` writes a small
generated plugin (`.opencode/plugin/weft.js`) that forwards OpenCode's plugin hooks to this
package's Node bundle, which runs the same WCP core as the Claude Code adapter
(`packages/adapters/claude-code/src`, via `host.ts`). Diagnostics are therefore byte-identical
to Claude Code's and Codex's.

```sh
WEFT_TOKEN=... node dist/weft-opencode.mjs install \
  --url https://weft-gateway-preview.<sub>.workers.dev --repo my-repo \
  --agent opencode-c --task T-3 --title "Session refresh" [--priority 0] [--mode enforce|advise]
```

| file | content |
|---|---|
| `.weft/opencode.json`, `.weft/token` (0600) | coordinator, repo, agent, task, `change` (Change-Id); the token never enters config, logs or git |
| `.opencode/plugin/weft.js` | generated bridge (absolute node + bundle paths; excluded from git) |
| git `commit-msg` / `pre-commit` | Change-Id/Task-Id/Agent-Id trailers; refuse commits while the session has open errors |
| `.weft/bin/weft` | the agent's `negotiate` / `inbox` command |

## Hook mapping

| OpenCode plugin hook | core event | WCP | level |
|---|---|---|---|
| `experimental.chat.system.transform` | SessionStart | `hello`; welcome + inbox pushed into the system prompt (full text on the first request, the one-line notice after) | L1 |
| `tool.execute.before` edit / write / multiedit | PreToolUse | analyze the proposed text, `submit check`; reject → **`throw new Error(reason)`**: OpenCode fails the tool call and the model reads the reason | L2 |
| `tool.execute.before` bash `git commit …` | PreToolUse Bash | `gate commit` → throw while errors are open | commit_gate |
| `tool.execute.after` | PostToolUse | `submit commit` with the real diff; verdict + inbox **appended to the tool output** | L1 |
| `event` `session.idle` | Stop | `gate stop` → `client.session.prompt(reason)` starts another turn (max 5 refusals for the same errors) | L3 |
| `event` `session.deleted` | SessionEnd | `bye` (kept open while errors are open) | |

Tool arguments map 1:1 (`filePath`→`file_path`, `oldString`/`newString`/`replaceAll`, `content`,
`edits[]`, `command`). `apply_patch`/`patch` (`patchText`, used by GPT-family models) is
**not checked before it runs**: it is accounted after the fact (one `commit` per file, diffed
against the before-text stashed at `tool.execute.before`). OpenCode's `edit` also applies
fuzzy (whitespace-tolerant) matches; when `oldString` does not match exactly, the proposed text
cannot be derived and the edit is only accounted after the fact.

Declared capabilities: `{level: 3, observe: sync, inject: immediate, deny_edit, refuse_stop, commit_gate: tool_interception}`.

## Verification status (OpenCode 1.18.31, model `opencode/big-pickle`)

Verified live against the preview gateway (`demo/b12-harnesses.mjs`, evidence `demo/evidence/b12/`):

- **L2**: a stale `write` of `src/auth/refresh.ts` was denied (`stale_assumption` caused by
  claude-a's signature change); the model read the reason, rewrote the call with the new
  signature, and the next write was accepted.
- **L1**: the welcome reached the model through the system prompt (it used `.weft/bin/weft inbox`
  unprompted); verdict text appended to tool output is what the model sees.
- **L3**: with the model told to give up, `session.idle` refusals arrived as new user turns,
  5 times, then the runaway guard let it stop (the open errors stay in the feed).

**Headless caveat:** a one-shot `opencode run` exits on `session.idle`, before the continuation
prompt runs, so the stop gate is only effective when the plugin lives in a long-lived process:
the TUI, or `opencode serve` with turns sent by `opencode run --attach <url>` (what the demo
does). In one-shot `run` the adapter still denies edits (L2) and injects context (L1); the
git pre-commit gate still holds.

Also: OpenCode resolves its project from `$PWD`, not the process cwd. Drivers must set `PWD`
(or pass `--dir`) or OpenCode works in the parent shell's directory.

## Development

```sh
pnpm --filter @weft/adapter-opencode test   # builds dist/weft-opencode.mjs; loads the generated plugin in Node against a local coordinator
```
